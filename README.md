# I Need a Product Idea

1. Improve the server automation so it isn't reliant on someone refreshing every day
2. Improve the server automation to update entries a few times a day
3. Improve the load more functionality to not always be showing unless there actually ARE more
4. Set up a loader for rendering

## Example object

```
{â€‹
    created_at: "2020-10-17T12:32:14.000Z"
    id: "1317443300979245056"
    public_metrics: {
        like_count: 31
        quote_count: 0
        reply_count: 3
        retweet_count: 6
    }
    query_id: "new-product-request"
